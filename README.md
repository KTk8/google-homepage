The Odin Project > Web Development 101 > Project: HTML/CSS
For this mini-project, we will deconstruct an existing webpage and rebuild it.
The goal is to practice how elements get placed on a page and roughly how they get styled and aligned.
This is also a chance to practice using the command line, git, and github.
