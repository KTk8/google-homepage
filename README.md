The Odin Project > Web Development 101 > Project: HTML/CSS
For this mini-project, we will deconstruct an existing webpage and rebuild it.
The goal is to practice how elements get placed on a page and roughly how they get styled and aligned.
This is also a chance to practice using the command line, git, and github.

Reflection at the end of the project...

There are a few things that are not included in this solution:
1. The apps icon in the header nav menu is supposed to get darker on hover. I used a screen-grab image to replicate that icon, so it is the color it is for now.
2. When focus is on the text box (in the search box), the border around the div (the whole search box, not the text box itself) is supposed to get a drop shadow. I know how to add a drop shadow to the text box on hover, but not to the div around it. I could make a branch to try a different approach, putting the border styling on the text box rather than the div, and figuring out how to have the magnifying glass icon overlap with the text box. But the instructions say "Don't be a perfectionist!" so I'm leaving it as is for now.
3. The footer menu should wrap when the viewport goes below a certain width, or a scroll bar should appear. Haven't figured these things out yet.
4. The magnifying glass icon in the search box is not positioned quite right. When I get it positioned correctly, it throws off the position of the text box. Leaving it as is for now and looking forward to learning how to position things properly.
