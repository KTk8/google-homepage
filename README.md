The Odin Project > Web Development 101 > Project: HTML/CSS
For this mini-project, we will deconstruct an existing webpage and rebuild it.
The goal is to practice how elements get placed on a page and roughly how they get styled and aligned.
This is also a chance to practice using the command line, git, and github.

Reflection at the end of the project...

There are a few things that are not included in this solution:
1. The apps icon in the header nav menu is supposed to get darker on hover. I used a screen-grab image to replicate that icon, so it is the color it is for now.
2. The footer menu should wrap when the viewport goes below a certain width, or a scroll bar should appear. Haven't figured these things out yet.
3. The magnifying glass icon in the search box is not positioned quite right. When I get it positioned correctly, it throws off the position of the text box. I'm leaving it as is for now and looking forward to learning how to position things properly.
